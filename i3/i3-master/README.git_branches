By default this SlackBuild script builds the git 'master' branch
of the i3 window manager. The 'master' branch contains the latest
stable release with all the bug fixes to date.

Another git testing branch is 'next' which includes features that
are going to be present in the next release.

To try i3 from the next branch, you need to run the script as follows:

VERSION=next ./i3.SlackBuild
